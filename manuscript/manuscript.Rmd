\section{introduction}

Body Mass Index (BMI) plays an important rule in predicting heart disease risk[@katbody]. Our goal is to compare 90th quatile regrission for BMI in Diabtese and prediabtes population.        

\section{Quantile regression}
Quantile regression is an important tool used to regress the dependent variable with high variance over the independent variables.The independent variabeles are Gender, Age, race, and statin use.   

For a random variable $X$, the comulative distrubution function (CDF) is $$F(X)=P(X\leq x)$$, and the $\tau$th quantile of $X$ is defined by $$ F^{-1}(\tau)=\text{inf}\{x: F(x)\ge \tau\} $$ where $0<\tau<1$.
Let the loss function is defined by $$\rho_{\tau}(u)= u(\tau-I(u<0))$$  
[@koenker2005]. The expected loss function is defined by
\begin{equation}
E\rho_{\tau}(X-\hat{x})=
\end{equation}

Least square method solve $$ \underset{\mu}{\text{min}}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\mu)^2$$

#Data
 The data used in this study is National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (NHANES)[@NHANES]. The data has
